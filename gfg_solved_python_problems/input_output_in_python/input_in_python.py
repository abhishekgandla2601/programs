# You need to perform three separate tasks based on the given input:
#
# String Input and Print: Take a text input as a string and print it as it is.
# Integer Input and Add: Take an integer input n, add 10 to it, and print the result.
# Float Input and Multiply: Take a floating-point number as input, multiply it by 10, and print the result.




# Take string input and print the string input
s=input()
print(s)
# Take integer input and add 10 to the integer input and print
n=int(input())
print(n+10)
# Take floating-point input and multiply the float input by 10 and print
f=float(input())
print(f*10)
