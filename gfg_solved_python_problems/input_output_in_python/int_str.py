# Given three inputs that are stored in the variables a, b, and c. You need to print a a times and b b times  in a single line separated by c.
#
# Examples:
#
# Input: a = 6, b = 4, c = &
# Output: 666666&4444
# Explanation: 6 printed 6 times and 4 printed 4 times seperated by c = &.

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=input()
print(str(a)*a + c + str(b)*b)
